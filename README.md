This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This template is used as part of the Devscale Bootcamp course.

## Getting Started

First you'd need the `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable. Ask one of the maintainer to get this

Then you can start :)

```
npm run dev
```
